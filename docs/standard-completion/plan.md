# Plan: finish the coding standard in yuf

Everything that is still open after the template engine rewrite (v4.27.0), see
[docs/standard-migration/remaining.md](../standard-migration/remaining.md). `actra/backend` follows when yuf is done.

## Decisions (user)

- Order: the redesigns first (static request and session state), then the areas one by one.
- `final` per area: each area release makes its classes `final` or documents them as extension point (abstract base
  class or PHPDoc "Extension point: …"). Classes that `actra/backend` extends are extension points unless the area
  release offers a better way (decided in the release): `BaseView`, `AuthUser`, `Authenticator`, `FrameworkDb`,
  `DbResultTable`, `Form`, `TextField`, `SelectOptionsField`, `TextAreaField`, `StringRule`.
- Enums first per area: fixed sets of string/int constants become backed enums (⚠️ with before/after); constants that
  are no fixed set (placeholders, defaults, limits) stay typed constants.
- `LogFile` stays as instance class (used by other projects as `new LogFile(…)` + `write()`; `core/Logger` has another
  purpose): the static facade `info()` / `debug()` / `error()` and the static registry of open files are removed.
- `src/phone/` and `src/mailer/` get the full standard (characterization tests first, license notices of the mailer
  kept).
- No backwards compatibility: renames and removals without aliases, every breaking change ⚠️ with before/after in
  `UPGRADE.md` (as in docs/standard-migration/plan.md).

## Definition of done for an area

Every area release does all of this for the classes of its area (and nothing outside it):

1. Characterization tests first where behaviour is not covered yet (hand-written doubles in `tests/Double/`).
2. PHPStan baseline entries of the area removed (types, array shapes, `mixed`, offsets).
3. Explicit comparisons (`isset()`, `empty()`, `==`, `?:`), `match` instead of `switch`, no `@`.
4. SPL or yuf exceptions instead of `new Exception(…)`; messages that say what is wrong.
5. `final` or documented extension point; `readonly` where possible; `@internal` for classes consumers should not use.
6. Enums for fixed sets; names per `naming.md`; lines ≤ 120 characters.
7. No new static state; static state of the area removed where the redesigns made it possible.
8. `UPGRADE.md` section, README if affected, handover note here, `composer check` green, `example/` checked.

## Steps

### Redesigns

1. **v4.28.0 – `LogFile` instance only (⚠️):** remove `info()`, `debug()`, `error()` and the static registry; `final`;
   constructor and `write()` stay (`logDirectory` since v4.26.0). Tests with a temporary log directory and a fixed
   clock. Small, so it goes first.
2. **`HttpRequest` as instance** (design first in `docs/http-request/design.md`, approved by the user): one object per
   request created by `Core` from the superglobals (`HttpRequest::fromGlobals()`), passed to `RequestHandler`, views
   (`ViewContext`), forms (`FormInput::fromGlobals()`), tables (`DbResultTable`, `TableFilter`), `SearchHelper`,
   `CspPolicySettings`, `HttpResponse`, `Logger` and `ExceptionHandler`; the static caches (`$inputData`, `$host`,
   `$protocol`, `$languages`) and `RequestBody::getData()` go away; fixed sets (`PROTOCOL_*`, request methods) as enums.
   Makes the request pipeline of `Core` testable. Several releases (decided in the design).
3. **Session object** (design first in `docs/session/design.md`): one session object per request instead of the static
   `AbstractSessionHandler::getSessionHandler()` / `enabled()` / `$GLOBALS`, `AuthSession`, `CsrfToken`,
   `FormNameRegistry`, `SessionFileUploadStorage::forCurrentRequest()` and the session state of `DbResultTable` /
   `TableFilter` / `SearchHelper`; removes the reflection in `AuthSessionTest`, `AuthenticatorTest`; the single-instance
   guards of `AuthUser` / `Authenticator`. Several releases (decided in the design).

### Areas (smallest first; after the redesigns)

Baseline entries today in brackets (state v4.27.0, 532 in total). Each line is one release unless it turns out too
large.

4. `response` (2), `pagination` (3), `request` (5): small, together if it stays small.
5. `security` (2) and the rest of `session` (3).
6. `exception` (15) and `datacheck` (13).
7. `html` (25) and `layout` (0, `final` only).
8. `auth` (26).
9. `api` (27).
10. `db` (51).
11. `table` (47).
12. `form` (0 baseline; `final` / extension points of 46 classes, superglobals after the redesigns).
13. `mailer` (36, full standard; characterization tests of the MIME output first).
14. `core` (89) and `Core.php` (18), incl. the test gaps of the request pipeline.
15. `common` (92).
16. `phone` (78, full standard; characterization tests first).

The order of 4–16 may change when a redesign already cleaned an area.

## Follow-up in other projects

- `actra/backend`: after each release as listed in its `UPGRADE.md` entry; the extension points it uses are decided in
  the area releases.
- Projects that use `LogFile` (`new LogFile(…)` + `write()`): add `logDirectory:` (v4.26.0); nothing else changes.

## Handover notes

### Step 1 (v4.28.0) – done

- `LogFile` is `final` and an instance class: `info()`, `debug()`, `error()`, `log()` and `$openLogFiles` removed; the
  class has no static state anymore (only private static helpers).
- Characterization tests in `tests/Unit/common/LogFileTest.php` passed against the old code before the change.
- The German `mkdir()` message check is replaced by a locale-independent check (`is_dir()` after `mkdir()`, errors
  silenced with a temporary error handler, no `@`). Directory or file failure throws a `RuntimeException`; the
  constructor throws if `fopen()` fails (bug fix). Baseline: 532 -> 525 entries (`uniqid()` entry stays).
